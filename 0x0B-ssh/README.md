SSH
In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server provided by ALX.

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
0. Use a private key - Bash script that uses ssh to connect to my Holberton-provided server.
1. Create an SSH key pair - Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
2. Client configuration file - SSH configuration file configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/holberton and to refuse authentication using a password.
